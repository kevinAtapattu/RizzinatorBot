The "rizzinator bot" is a very simple chatbot that I created using Discord API so I am able to interact with users in the app.

This bot was my first ever personal project I have created and I hope in several years, I am able to look back at this very simple project and ask myself "what was I doing"

The inspiration behind this project is pretty funny! My friends know me as the one friend who has the best "rizz" out of all of us and one day, one of my friends said "you have that AI generated rizz". 
This funny comment is what sparked an idea in my head to incoporate that into reality somehow. 

I plan to make more advanced changes to this project in the future with implementations such as using actual AI to interact with users in discord.
